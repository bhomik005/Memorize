/**
 
 In Swift UI , a struct can have variables and functions and a struct is a composite data types
 Content View is a struct and it  conforms to protocol View (it behaves like a View / functions like a View)
 If you want to behave like a View, you must have a var body which behaves like some View
 body is a computed property (readonly) - its value gets computed when someone ask for the value of body as it is not a stored value
 the type of this body could be any struct in the world as long as it behaves like a View
 Never have a function more than 20 lines of code ( 12 lines preferrably)
 Views are immutable ( we use state var to change the views)
 Array out of bounds is a crasher in swift
